# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The plugin sources live in `src/`, with `main.ts` hosting the primary Orca integration logic and `utils/`, `services/`, and `libs/` supplying shared helpers. Runtime assets generated by Vite land in `dist/` and should not be edited manually. Documentation and marketing collateral are stored in `docs/` and `plugin-docs/`, while release automation scripts reside in `scripts/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `npm run dev` to launch the Vite development server inside Orca's sandbox. Ship builds with `npm run build`, which runs TypeScript compilation followed by the Vite bundle. `npm run preview` serves the production bundle for spot checks, and `npm run typecheck` is the quickest way to ensure type safety. Clean old artifacts with `npm run clean` before packaging or publishing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
TypeScript is the default language. Follow the existing two-space indentation, prefer arrow functions for callbacks, and keep React-style JSX in helper factories under `utils/uiCreationUtils.ts`. Interfaces and types are PascalCase, while variables and functions stay camelCase. Run the project through Vite to confirm ESLint and SWC transformations succeed before submitting changes.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no dedicated unit-test suite yet, so lean on `npm run dev` for interactive validation in Orca and `npm run typecheck` to catch regressions. When fixing performance-sensitive code, profile with the built-in logging utilities (`simpleLog`, `performanceOptimizer`) and record manual verification steps in the pull request.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commits in this repo mix Chinese and English but consistently start with an imperative summary (e.g., `修复`, `feat`). Keep messages short, mention affected modules, and group related changes in one commit. Pull requests should describe the scenario, outline verification steps, and link to the Orca issue or task when available. Include screenshots or gifs whenever UI behaviour changes so reviewers can confirm the result quickly.
